# venue-taxonomy

The intention of this project is to standardize the list of venue types that represent
Digital-Out-of-Home (DOOH) advertising screens within a programmatic OpenRTB 2.5 context.

The systematization of DOOH venue types will allow for clearer targeting by media buying
platforms across a spectrum of available supply-side platforms offering DOOH inventory.
